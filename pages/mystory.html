        <p>Travis Brown has claimed Rexburg as his home for nearly eight years. Originally from Canada, he chose to attend school in Rexburg at Brigham Young University-Idaho. Having experienced poverty as a child, being the oldest of his eight siblings,
            and losing his mother when he was ten, Travis learned the true value of hard work, and resilience. These acquired traits enabled him to pay his way through a two-year LDS mission in Las Vegas, Nevada. Through that same natural dedication and
            solid focus on responsibility he has worked his own way through college as a full-time building supervisor at BYU-Idaho where he studies part-time. It was here that he met his wife, and after struggling with infertility, welcomed their baby
            girl, Adeline, into their family. Travis Brown has been a trusted employee and leader wherever he has gone, including his full-time job on campus. Travis and his wife, Abegeal, have been the managers of the Rexburg Farmers Market during the
            summer season for multiple years, and have plans to continue running the market for the foreseeable future. The friends they have made here are considered family and they plan to remain in Rexburg for as long as possible, having felt incredible
            support and care from the loving community here.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Travis seeks to give back to the community as much as possible, having already been an involved and informed voter for the county since he first arrived to Rexburg. He and his wife volunteer for and support programs designed to assist those in
            need, ranging from families who need some extra help — such as the EBT system at the Farmers Market — to supporting community programs such as the animal shelter.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Being a young father, as well as an involved community member, Travis is able to relate to many of the different groups in Rexburg. And even if he can’t directly relate, he loves to hear other people’s opinions and learn from their knowledge and
            life experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="last">More of Travis and Abegeal’s story and experience with the Farmers Market can be heard on their <a href="https://www.byui.edu/radio/the-rexburg-farmers-market">BYU-i Radio interview</a> as well as their interview on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/therexburghustle/videos/636266250228143/">Rexburg Hustle Podcast</a>            from earlier this year.</p>
